My name is Fábris Kossoski and I am a researcher at the [Laboratoire de Chimie et Physique Quantiques](https://www.lcpq.ups-tlse.fr/?lang=en), in Toulouse, France.

I develop theoretical methods and computational software to model molecular systems and how they behave when interacting with free electrons and with light.

I am interested in seeking novel **electronic structure** methods, with a particular focus on molecular excited states.
This is done in close collaboration with [Pierre-François Loos](https://pfloos.github.io/WEB_LOOS/).
Many types of molecular states can spontaneously eject an electron, which make them theoretically challenging and also fascinating. These are resonances.
To model this type of state, I have been implementing a computational code based on **electron scattering** methodologies.
In addition to the electronic problem, I also develop nonadiabatic dynamics methods to investigate the vast chemical processes that
take place upon electron collisions (**electron-induced chemistry**) and light absorption (**photochemistry**).
I am also interested in applying these theoretical and computational tools to solve problems of chemical relevance.
This is often done in close [collaboration](https://kossoski.github.io/collaborations/) with different experimental and theoretical groups.

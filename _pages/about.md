My name is Fábris Kossoski.
I do research in Theoretical Chemistry and \
Molecular Physics, at the [Laboratoire de Chimie et Physique Quantiques](https://www.lcpq.ups-tlse.fr/?lang=en), in Toulouse, France.

I develop theoretical methods and computational software to model molecular systems and their interactions with free electrons and with photons.
My effort covers three fronts: **electronic structure**, **electron scattering**, and **nonadiabatic dynamics** methodologies.

I seek novel **electronic structure** methods, with a particular focus on molecular excited states.
This is done in close collaboration with [Pierre-François Loos](https://pfloos.github.io/WEB_LOOS/).

Many types of molecular states can spontaneously eject an electron.
These are resonances, which I model with **electron scattering** methodologies.
In particular, I develop a computational code based on the Schwinger multichannel method.

In addition to the electronic problem, I investigate **electron-induced chemistry** and **photochemistry**, which I model with nonadiabatic dynamics simulations.

In addition to developing methods, I apply them to solve problems of chemical relevance.
This is often done in close [collaboration](https://kossoski.github.io/collaborations/) with different experimental and theoretical groups.

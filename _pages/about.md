Welcome! My name is Fábris Kossoski.
I do research in Theoretical Chemistry and \
Molecular Physics, at the [Laboratoire de Chimie et Physique Quantiques](https://www.lcpq.ups-tlse.fr/?lang=en), in Toulouse, France.

I develop state-of-the-art theoretical methods and computational softwares to model molecular systems and their interactions with free electrons and photons.
My effort covers three fronts: **electronic structure**, **nonadiabatic dynamics** and **electron scattering** methodologies.

In collaboration with [Pierre-François Loos](https://pfloos.github.io/WEB_LOOS/),
we seek novel electronic structure methods, with a particular focus on molecular excited states.
I am also interested in simulating electron-induced chemistry, photoinduced chemistry and photoabsorption with mixed quantum-classical dynamics simulations.
Finally, I am one of the main developers of the Schwinger multichannel method, an ab-initio formulation to investigate electron scattering from molecules.

In addition to developing, I also interested in **applications**. I apply these theoretical and computational tools to tackle problems of chemical relevance.
In particular, I simulate how free electrons can break molecules apart.
This is a fundamental physical-chemical process, playing major roles in many natural and man-made environments.
I also work in close collaboration with several experimental groups on various aspects of the electron-molecule collision.
